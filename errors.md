# Build Errors for shelf-serpent-desktop

## Compilation Output Summary
- Total errors: 39
- Main affected file: `src/commands/mod.rs`

## Unresolved Modules
- None found in the current build output.

## Missing Types
1. **Type: `SyncStatus`**
   - Location: `src/commands/mod.rs:232`
   - Error: `cannot find type SyncStatus in this scope`
   - Suggestion: Use `SyncState` instead (similar type exists)
   - Occurrences: Line 232 (appears twice in error output)

## Syntax Errors

### Character Encoding Issues (`unknown start of token: \u{3}`)
These errors appear to be caused by corrupted characters in the source code:

1. **Line 129**: 
   - Position 14: `StateΓÉâ<` (after `State`)
   - Position 31: `DatabaseStateΓÉâ>` (after `DatabaseState`)
   
2. **Line 131**:
   - Position 12: `ResultΓÉâ<` (after `Result`)
   - Position 24: `StringΓÉâ>` (after `String`)

3. **Line 154**:
   - Position 14: `StateΓÉâ<` (after `State`)
   - Position 31: `DatabaseStateΓÉâ>` (after `DatabaseState`)

4. **Line 156**:
   - Position 12: `ResultΓÉâ<` (after `Result`)
   - Position 24: `StringΓÉâ>` (after `String`)

5. **Line 179**:
   - Position 14: `StateΓÉâ<` (after `State`)
   - Position 31: `DatabaseStateΓÉâ>` (after `DatabaseState`)

6. **Line 181**:
   - Position 12: `ResultΓÉâ<` (after `Result`)
   - Position 24: `StringΓÉâ>` (after `String`)

7. **Line 200**:
   - Position 14: `StateΓÉâ<` (after `State`)
   - Position 31: `DatabaseStateΓÉâ>` (after `DatabaseState`)

8. **Line 202**:
   - Position 12: `ResultΓÉâ<` (after `Result`)
   - Position 24: `StringΓÉâ>` (after `String`)

### Parser Errors (resulting from character encoding issues)
These errors are consequences of the above encoding issues:

1. **Line 129**: `expected one of >, a const expression, lifetime, or type, found ,`
2. **Line 129**: `expected one of :, @, or |, found >`
3. **Line 154**: Same as line 129
4. **Line 179**: Same as line 129
5. **Line 200**: Same as line 129

## Method Not Found Errors

All these errors relate to methods being called on `State<'_, SyncState>` that don't exist:

1. **Line 233**: `get_sync_status` - method not found
2. **Line 241**: `full_sync` - method not found
3. **Line 250**: `is_online` - method not found
4. **Line 260**: `check_connectivity` - method not found
5. **Line 270**: `check_connectivity` - method not found (second occurrence)
6. **Line 290**: `get_sync_status` - method not found (second occurrence)
7. **Line 305**: `maintain_session` - method not found
8. **Line 313**: `restore_session` - method not found
9. **Line 322**: `full_sync` - method not found (second occurrence)

## Root Causes Summary

1. **Character Encoding Issue**: The main issue appears to be corrupted angle brackets (`<` and `>`) in generic type declarations, where they've been replaced with `ΓÉâ<` and `ΓÉâ>` sequences.

2. **Missing Type**: `SyncStatus` type doesn't exist, should probably be `SyncState`.

3. **Missing Methods**: The `State<'_, SyncState>` type is missing several methods that are being called. This suggests either:
   - The methods should be called on a different object
   - The methods need to be implemented
   - There's a missing trait implementation

## Fix Priority

1. **First**: Fix character encoding issues in `src/commands/mod.rs` (lines 129, 131, 154, 156, 179, 181, 200, 202)
2. **Second**: Rename `SyncStatus` to `SyncState` on line 232
3. **Third**: Address the missing methods issue by examining the `SyncState` implementation
